## Quick Start
If you want to code and go then we welcome you to check out the ["companion" repository](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started) we made to accompany this guide.


To get the code from this walkthrough, you can simply clone the repo, install dependencies, and off you go!
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started
$ cd greenwood-getting-started

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Done!
