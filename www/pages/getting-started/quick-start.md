## Quick Start

If you want to get right into some code, we have a few options to get you started with building with Greenwood right away:

- Init Command
- Command Line (w/ `npx`)
- Clone GitHub Repo
- Stackblitz âš¡

### Init Package

You can use Greenwood's [`init` package](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/blob/master/packages/init/README.md) to scaffold out a new Greenwood project for you that will be all set and ready for you start using.

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app

npx @greenwood/init@latest
```

### Command Line

Additionally, you can start your own project right now as easy as 1.. 2.. 3, right from your terminal!
```bash
# with NodeJS already installed
# create a pages directory for your content
$ mkdir -p src/pages

# create an index.md file as your home page
$ echo "## hello world" > src/pages/index.md

# run one of Greenwood's commands, and that's it!
$ npx @greenwood/cli develop
```

### Clone GitHub Repo
If you just want to _clone and go_ then we welcome you to check out the [companion repo](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started) we made to accompany this guide.  To get the code from this walkthrough, you can simply clone the repo, install dependencies, and off you go!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started
$ cd greenwood-getting-started

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Done!

### Stackblitz

Greenwood thinks there's a world where you never have to leave the browser to build and author content for your site, and after you see our starter working [in Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/projectevergreen/greenwood-getting-started?embed=1), we think you'll be a believer too!
