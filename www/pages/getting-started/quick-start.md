## Quick Start
If you want to code and go then we welcome you to check out the ["companion" repository](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started) we made to accompany this guide.


To get the code from this walkthrough, you can simply clone the repo, install dependencies, and off you go!
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started
$ cd greenwood-getting-started

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Done!


Additionally, you can start your own project right now as easy as 1.. 2.. 3, right from the command line!
```bash
# with NodeJS already installed
# create a pages directory for your content
$ mkdir -p src/pages

# create an index.md file as your home page
$ echo "## hello world" > src/pages/index.md

# run one of Greenwood's commands, and that's it!
$ npx @greenwood/cli develop
```

_To learn more about what you can do with Greenwood, head over to our [documentation](/docs/) or feel to review the other sections in this guide.  To setup a project from scratch, you can pick up the rest of the getting started guide in the [project setup](/getting-started/project-setup) page._
