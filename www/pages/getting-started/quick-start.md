## Quick Start
If you want to code and go then we encourage you check out the repository we made to accompany this Getting Started guide.


To get to the code from this walkthrough, you can simply clone the repo, install dependencies, and off you go!
```render bash
$ git clone https://github.com/thescientist13/greenwood-getting-started
$ cd greenwood-getting-started

$ npm install

$ npm start
```

Done!
