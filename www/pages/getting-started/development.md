## Development

Greenwood's development server will automatically recompile if you make any changes to your pages/templates/components/styles. This is really handy when you want to quickly test changes.

We will run Greenwood's development server throughout this guide so you can quickly view/test changes.

Start Greenwood's development server from within your greenwood project with:

```render bash
yarn develop
```
