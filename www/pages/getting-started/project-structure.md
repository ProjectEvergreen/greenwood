## Project Structure

To start our project we need to have the right structure. Greenwood relies on this basic structure in order to function properly.  You can provide your own custom configurations later if you want to change the default project workspace.

### Workspace

For now, create a new workspace folder in your cloned greenwood project named `src`

#### Pages

Within your `src` directory create a new folder called `pages`.  This `pages` directory will contain all the static pages you want to add.

#### Templates

Within your `src` directory create a new folder called `templates`.  This `templates` directory will contain your custom page and app templates.

#### Styles

Within your `src` directory create a new folder called `styles`.  This `styles` directory will contain your custom theme css

#### Components

Within your `src` directory create a new folder called `components`.  This `components` directory will contain your custom components.

### Summary

Your project's directory should appear like this:

```render bash
└── src
    ├── components
    ├── pages
    ├── styles
    └── templates
```
