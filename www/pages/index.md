### Developer and Community Friendly
First and foremost, Greenwood aims to be developer friendly.  We want to provide the capabilities and tooling to help you build your application, getting out of the way as much as possible.  We value documentation and transparency and encourage all to particpate in our GitHub on features you would like or any bug reports you may have.

We greatly encourage contributions to our documentation and website to make sure everything is as clear and useful as possible and that we can make the experience even better for the next person who comes along.


### Modern Apps with a Modern Toolchain
At the heart of Greenwood is an "evergreen" build, that aims to deliver the most performant and optimized user experience to your users.  Develop like it's a Single Page Application, deploy like it's a static site.  (because it is!)

Don't worry about any of that though, we'll handle it all for you and for the rest just read our [guides][/guides].

### Flexible and Accomodating
Even if you don't know anything about webpack or Web Components, if you can learn little markdown, you can get started making a modern website right away.


As you become more famliar with modern JavaScript and CSS, you can bring that knowledge to Greenwood and continue to expand the capabilities of yourt application.
