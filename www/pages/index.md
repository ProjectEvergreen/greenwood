## Greenwood is a modern and performant static site generator.

Greenwood focuses on providing an accessible and productive modern development workflow supporting modern JavaScript and CSS features like Web Components, FlexBox, CSS Grid, and Modules.  We we hope that development experience is as modern and permformant as the resulting user experience and that you'll be just as happy building your own site as we were with building Greenwood.
