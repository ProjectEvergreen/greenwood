## Webpack Plugins

> This is an expiremental API! [YMMV](http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/your-mileage-may-vary)

Although Greenwood aims to provide a complete development environment out of the box, we recognize that for those users who are comfortable with webpack and want to introduce customizations using actual webpack plugins.


## Usage
Below is an example of using the [Banner Plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/banner-plugin/) to add text to each file generated by webpack.  In this case, it is including the version of your NodeJS project.

```render javascript
const { version } = require('package.json');

module.exports = {

  ...
  
  plugins: [{
    type: 'webpack',
    provider: (compilation) => {
      return new webpack.BannerPlugin(\`My App v${version}\`);
    }
  }]

}
```

## Compatibility
Although we can't promise all webpack plugins will work, we will try and document which ones we have had success with either as part of the CLI or one of our composite plugins.
