## Webpack Plugins

> This is an experimental API! [YMMV](http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/your-mileage-may-vary)

Although Greenwood aims to provide a complete development environment out of the box, we recognize that for those users who are comfortable with webpack might want to introduce customizations using actual webpack plugins themselves.


## Usage
Below is an example of using the [Banner Plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/banner-plugin/) to add text to each file generated by webpack in _greenwood.config.js_.

```render javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');
const { version } = require('package.json');

module.exports = {

  ...

  plugins: [{
    type: 'webpack',
    provider: () => {
      return new webpack.BannerPlugin(\`My App v${version}\`);
    }
  }]

}
```

## Compatibility
Although we can't promise all webpack plugins will work, we will try and document which ones we have had success with either as part of the CLI or one of our composite plugins.
| Name  | Notes  |
|---|---|
| [BannerPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/banner-plugin/) | Used as an example in unit tests for `@greenwood/cli`. |
| [CopyWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/) | Used as part of our [Polyfills Plugin (`@greenwood/plugin-polyfills`)](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/tree/master/packages/plugin-polyfills) to copy `@webcomponentsjs/*` polyflls files to Greenwood's output directory. (`publicDir`).
