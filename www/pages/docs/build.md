# Build Configurations

### Webpack

The webpack config for production(`webpack.config.prod.js`) and development(`webpack.config.develop.js`) can be overridden by providing your own custom configuration within your project's directory.  If you wish to revert back to the default provided configuration, simply delete these 2 files from your project's root directory.
