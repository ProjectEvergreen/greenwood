## Scripts and Imports
**Greenwood** generally does not have any opinion on how you structure your site, aside from the pre-determined _pages/_ and (optional) _templates/_ directories.  It supports all standard files that you can open in a web browser.


### Script Tags
Script tags can be done in any standards compliant way that will work in a browser.  So just as in HTML, you can do anything you need, like below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" prefix="og:http://ogp.me/ns#">

  <head>
    <script>
      alert('hello');
    </script>

    <script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/...."></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
  
</html>
```

### Imports
Greenwood also supports (and recommends) usage of ECMAScript Modules (ESM), like in the example below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" prefix="og:http://ogp.me/ns#">

  <head>
    <script type="module">
      import { Foo } from '/path/to/foo.js';

      Foo.something();
    </script>

    <script type="module" src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
  
</html>
```

### Extensions and Bare Imports

One important note to consider is that ESM by spec definition, expects a couple important characteristics from an `import` path:
1. It must be a relative path
1. It must have an extension

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->
```js
// happy panda
import { Foo } from './foo.js';
```

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->
```js
// sad panda
import { Foo } from './foo';
```

However, Greenwood also supports [bare module specifiers](https://lit.dev/docs/v1/tools/build/#bare-module-specifiers) for packages you install with a package manager from **npm**.
<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->
```js
import { html, LitElement } from 'lit';
```

By [creating an import map for you](/about/how-it-works/#cli), Greenwood knows how resolve these but it will _only_ look in _node_modules_.

As a bonus, Greenwood also auto resolves paths with references to _node_modules_ as well if the path starts with `/node_modules/`
```html
<script type="module">
  import { Foo } from '/node_modules/foo/dist/main.js';

  Foo.something();
</script>
```

So the rule of thumb is:
- If it's a package from npm, you can use bare specifiers and no extension
- Otherwise, you will need to use a relative path and the extension
