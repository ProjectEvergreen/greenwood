## Features

#### Onboarding
We built Greenwood in the hopes that getting started would be easy.  By default Greenwood will build an app for you.  Just simply start adding pages and customizing templates as needed and you're good to go!  You pick your workspace, Greenwood makes as few assumptions as needed to deliver an optimal development experience with minimum configuration needed.

We strive to provide good documentation, intuitive developer experiences, and stable workflows.  Even if you don't know anything about webpack or Web Components, if you can learn a little markdown, you can get started making a modern website right away!  


#### Modern Apps, Modern Toolchains
At the heart of Greenwood is an "evergreen" build, that aims to deliver the most optimized user experience through a combination of tools like webpack, babel, and PostCSS.  

Develop like it's a Single Page Application, deploy like it's a static site.  (because it is!)


#### Performance
We believe delivering a great user experience is above all else the most crucial element to a successful web product and part of that means performance out of the box.  Greenwood wants to help your site be one of the fastest out there and so we'll take care of all those optimizations for you, ensuring your site gets a great score in tools like [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), one of our primary performance benchmarking tools.
