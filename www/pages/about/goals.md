### Developer and Community Friendly
First and foremost, Greenwood aims to be developer friendly.  We want to provide the capabilities and tooling to help you build your application, getting out of the way as much as possible.  We value documentation and transparency and encourage all to particpate in our GitHub on features you would like or any bug reports you may have.

We greatly encourage contributions to our documentation and website to make sure everything is as clear and useful as possible and that we can make the experience even better for the next person who comes along.
