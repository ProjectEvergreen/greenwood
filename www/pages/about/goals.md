## Goals

#### It's Not About Us
First and foremost, Greenwood aims to be developer friendly.  We want to provide you the capabilities and the right amount of tooling and options to help accelerate your workflow and build your project.  We value documentation and transparency into our project's roadmap and decision making, and encourage all to participate in our [GitHub](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood) issues, discussions, and pull requests.  We want to hear from you about what you think would make Greenwood better!



#### Continuous Learning
In addition, we want Greenwood to be a project that everyone can have access to and be able to use knowing only the shared knowledge base of the web platform.   We love Web Components, Flex Box, EMCAScript modules and everything else the web has to offer, and want to make sure that delivering modern apps for a modern web is painless and easy for everyone.  As the web grows and evolves, so will Greenwood.  Our desire to learn all about the web will help ensure Greenwood is always able to deliver the best experiences for users Greenwood, and of the web.


#### Collaborative
We greatly encourage contributions to our documentation and website to make sure everything is as clear and useful as possible and keep us honest in providing the the best developer experience possible.  Please feel free to engage us in GitHub, Twitter, or any of our other outlets.  (check out the site header for ways you can connect with the team, we'd love to hear from you!  ❤️)
