# Greenwood v0.21.0

**Published: Jan 8, 2022**

## What's New

As the Greenwood teams continues on its path towards a [1.0 release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MwDkszKvq81QgIYa8utJgyUgSpLZQx9eKCWjIikvfHU/edit#heading=h.belq6qnmcr0h), we are especially excited to share this new release which adds the capability to pull in content from external sources as part of generating a site.  This is perfect for integrating with a Headless CMS, custom API, database, or even the filesystem.  It's really up to you! ⚙️

We also improved the `@greenwood/init` command with the ability to scaffold from a template now!

### External Data Sources

## How It Works
With this new API added to Greenwood, pulling in external content into your site is super easy.  At minimum, you will just need to define a `route` and a `body` for each page you want to add.  For example, here is how you could pull from an "artists" API, returning an array of pages, that Greenwood will then use to statically generate a page for each artist with.

```js
const customExternalSourcesPlugin = {
  type: 'source',
  name: 'source-plugin-artists',
  provider: () => {
    return async function () {
      const artists = await fetch('http://.../api/artists').then(resp => resp.json());

      return artists.map((artist) => {
        const { bio, id, imageUrl, name } = artist;
        const route = `/artists/${name.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-')}/`;

        // body and route are required fields
        return {
          route,
          title: name,
          body: `
            <p>${bio}</p>
            <img src='${imageUrl}'/>
          `
        };
      });
    };
  }
};
```

And then when running the build, you would get the following output. ✨
```bash
.
└── public/
  ├── index.html
  ├── ...
  └── artists/
    ├── <name1>/index.html
    ├── <name2>/index.html
    └── <nameN>/index.html
```

## Init Template
To scaffold your new project based on one of [Greenwood's starter templates](https://github.com/orgs/ProjectEvergreen/repositories?q=greenwood-template-&type=all&language=&sort=), pass the `--template` flag and then follow the prompts to complete the scaffolding.

```bash
# example
npx @greenwood/init --template
-------------------------------------------------------
Initialize Greenwood Template ♻️
-------------------------------------------------------
? Which template would you like to use? (Use arrow keys)
❯ blog
```

You can also pass the template you want from the CLI too.
```bash
# example
npx @greenwood/init --template=blog
```
