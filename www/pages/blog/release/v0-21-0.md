# Greenwood v0.21.0

## What's New

As the Greenwood teams continues on its path towards a [1.0 release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MwDkszKvq81QgIYa8utJgyUgSpLZQx9eKCWjIikvfHU/edit#heading=h.belq6qnmcr0h), we are especially excited to share this new release which adds the capablity to pull in content from external sources as part of generating a site.  This is perfect for integrating with a Headless CMS, custom API, database, or even the filesystem.  It's really up to you! ⚙️


## How It Works
With this new API added to Greenood, pulling in external content into your site is super easy.  At minimum, you will just need to define a `route` and a `body` for each page you want to add.  For example, here is how you could pull from an "artists" API, returning an array of pages, that Greenwood will then use to statically generate a page for each artist with.

```js
const customExternalSourcesPlugin = {
  type: 'source',
  name: 'source-plugin-artists',
  provider: () => {
    return async function () {
      const artists = await fetch('http://.../api/artists').then(resp => resp.json());

      return artists.map((artist) => {
        const { bio, id, imageUrl, name } = artist;
        const route = `/artists/${name.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-')}/`;

        // body and route are required fields
        return {
          route,
          title: name,
          body: `
            <p>${bio}</p>
            <img src='${imageUrl}'/>
          `
        };
      });
    };
  }
};
```

And then when running the build, you would get the following output. ✨
```bash
.
└── public/
  ├── index.html
  ├── ...
  └── artists/
    ├── <name1>/index.html
    ├── <name2>/index.html
    └── <nameN>/index.html
```
