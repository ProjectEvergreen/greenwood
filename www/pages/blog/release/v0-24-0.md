# Greenwood v0.24.0

**Published: Mar 6, 2022**

## What's New
For this release, the Greenwood team would like to highlight how we were able to improve the speed of local development, and our decision to favor content over configuration.  Let's dive in! 🤿


### Local Development Enhancements
Greenwood understands the importance of a tight feedback loop and we are excited to share with you one of the key enhancements we made in this area.  By using [`E-Tag`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag) headers to send `304` HTTP status code, the browser can avoid unnecessarily needing to transfer and process unchanged files during development.  This is very similar to how a CDN functions.

Let's step through how it works. 👀

> ⚠️ Make sure you don't have _Disable Cache_ set in your dev tools!  ⚠️ 

For this walk through, we're demonstrating how we tested it using the Greenwood website.
1. Open a new tab with the network tab open
1. Load the website with the `develop` command and observe the status of all requests is `200`

1. Refresh and now the status should change to `304`

1. Change a file (in this case a CSS file) and observe now that now there has been a change, the status is `200` and the page should have changed the color of the text.  But!  All the other files return a `304`

1. Keep refreshing, and the status should now go back to `304` for all requests

Combined with another change to "cache" import maps, we are now seeing about [a 30-50% reduction in page load times for development](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/pull/760#issuecomment-1046120992)!

Neat!

### Favor Content Over Configuration

> 🛑 **This is a breaking change** 🛑

At the initial outset of Greenwood, one way to set metadata in your HTML was through Greenwood's configuration file.
```js
export default {
  title: 'My Website',
  meta: [
    { name: 'description', content: 'The website for my blog and portfolio.' },
    { name: 'twitter:site', content: '@Username' },
    { rel: 'icon', href: '/favicon.ico' }
    // ...
  ]
};
```

However, as [our project and vision has matured](/blog/state-of-greenwood-2022/), we firmly believe content should not live in configuration and so we are favoring usage of HTML for this instead.  For Greenwood, it is more important that you can own your code and your content, and so for us, this means removing these configuration options.
