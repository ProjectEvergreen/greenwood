## What's New

The Greenwood team is back with a new release and we're excited to share with you what we've been up to!  This release comes with these major features we'd like to share with you:

1. Netlify and Vercel Serverless Adapters
1. Web Server Components
1. Static Asset Bundling

Let's check them out! üëá

### Serverless Adapters

In this release, Greenwood now makes [available a plugin API](/plugins/adapter/) for hooking into the end of the build lifecycle, specifically designed for these new adapter plugins to be run.  After the Greenwood build completes, these plugins can run and "adapt" the standard Greenwood build output to whatever format and distribution conventions are required for a given platform like [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/) or [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/).

It's as easy as installing and adding the plugin to your _greenwood.config.js_!
```js
// import { greenwoodPluginAdapterVercel } from '@greenwood/plugin-adapter-vercel';
import { greenwoodPluginAdapterNetlify } from '@greenwood/plugin-adapter-netlify';

export default {
  plugins: [
    greenwoodPluginAdapterNetlify()
  ]
}
```

Check out the README docs for our currently supported [**Netlify**](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/tree/rmaster/packages/plugin-adapter-netlify) and [**Vercel**](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/tree/rmaster/packages/plugin-adapter-vercel) plugins, and keep your eye out for future plugins as we look to also land support for [**AWS**](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/1142) and [**Cloudflare**](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/1143). üëÄ

### Web Server Components

Although [Custom Elements as pages](/blog/release/v0-26-0/#custom-elements-as-pages) are not a new feature, as Greenwood continues to enhance its capabilities on the backend as a full-stack solution, hooking these pages into the request / response lifecycle was an obvious need, and so we are now "promoting" these custom elements as pages to a new name; _Web Server Components_.  ‚ú®

The API is still the same and continues to run only on the server, except now Greenwood will provide the `Request` object for the incoming request as a ["constructor prop"](/docs/server-rendering/#data-loading), allowing request time handling to occur within the custom element.

```js
export default class PostPage extends HTMLElement {
  constructor(request) {
    super();

    const params = new URLSearchParams(request.url.slice(request.url.indexOf('?')));
    this.postId = params.get('id');
  }

  async connectedCallback() {
    const { postId } = this;
    const post = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${postId}`).then(resp => resp.json());
    const { id, title, body } = post;

    this.innerHTML = `
      <h1>Fetched Post ID: ${id}</h1>
      <h2>${title}</h2>
      <p>${body}</p>
    `;
  }
}
```

> _We plan to continue to build on this concept and fleshing out Greenwood's data loading amd full stack capabilities through such planned features like [content as data](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/1167), [dynamic routing](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/882), and [hydration](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/880)._


### Static Asset Bundling

As an alternative to the pre-defined [_assets/_ directory](/docs/css-and-images/), Greenwood now handles static asset "bundling" when referencing assets like images In your JavaScript.  Through a combination of [`new URL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) and [`import.meta.url`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta), your image can now be located anywhere in your project!

```js
const logo = new URL('../path/images/logo.svg', import.meta.url);

class Header extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>
        <!-- handles nested routes / deeplinking, e.g. https://www.mysite.com/some/page/ -->
        <img src="${logo.pathname.replace(window.location.pathname, '/')}" alt="My logo"/>
      </header>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define('app-header', Header);
```

For production builds, Greenwood will generate a unique filename for the asset as well!  e.g. _logo-83bc009f.svg_. üíØ

> _We are looking to improve the developer experience around this pattern so please feel free to follow along or comment in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/1163)._

## What's Next

We're really excited to see the progress **Greenwood** has been able to make this year, and are looking forward to seeing where the community can take it.  As we get closer to finalizing our [1.0 Roadmap](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/milestone/3), we've been playing around with more community projects and making little demos with them to share, which we encourage you to check out to see what Greenwood is capable of and help push the limits of the full-stack web!
