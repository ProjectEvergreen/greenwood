# Greenwood v0.27.0

**Published: November 22, 2022**

## What's New

Innovations in the industry like the opportunities that come with [serverless and edge platforms](https://github.com/thescientist13/web-components-at-the-edge), combined with the emergence of [Web API based runtimes](https://wintercg.org/), have been motivating the Greenwood team for a while now.  In particular, how to make the experience of writing sites and applications more consistent across the entire stack, especially for web standards and Web Components.  In our [last release](/blog/release/v0-26-0), we introduced [**Web Components Compiler (WCC)**](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/wcc), which made writing native Web Components for SSR even easier for developers, and enabling us to introduce our own unique innovation for [custom elements as pages](/blog/release/v0-26-0/#custom-elements-as-pages).

Greenwood is ecstatic to embrace this future for the web, in which there is a world where dynamic can be just as practical as static, and the web can be all around you.  With this release, Greenwood is coming to deliver another step towards making sure it's as easy to write a Web Component on the server, at it is in the browser; introducing _**Full Stack Web Components**_! âœ¨

Let's explore this concept through the first feature highlight of this release, called _Custom Imports_.

### Custom Imports

While Greenwood has had plugins to support using ESM for non standard module formats like CSS and JSON, these were only supported for client side (browser) use cases.  When we introduced SSR and custom elements as pages, trying to `import` a CSS file in a server route would break.  But, no more!

Starting with _.css_ and _.json_, you can now use ESM to include these assets right into your SSR and `prerender` pages!

```js
// src/pages/index.js
import packageJson from '../../package.json';
import css from '../main.css';

export default class Home extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <head>
        <title>${packageJson.name}</title>

        <style>
          ${css}
        </style>
      </head>

      <body>
        <!-- ... -->
      </body>
    `;
  }
}
```

This currently depends on an experimental feature in NodeJS `v16.17.0` so checkout our [documentation](/docs/server-rendering/#custom-imports) for full details and usage instructions.


> _Before the Greenwood `v1.0.0` release, do we aim to align this syntax on the [**Import Assertions** spec](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/923), while also looking to support [additional custom import formats like TypeScript and GraphQL](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/1004)._

### CSS Bundling and Minification

One goal Greenwood had from the outset was to minimize as much as possible the reliance on external dependencies and third party libraries, choosing to [eschew the common trend of building a "meta" framework](https://projectevergreen.github.io/blog/always-bet-on-html/).  It's this perspective that we feel classifies Greenwood better as a "workbench", not a framework.  Although **PostCSS** is an invaluable tool in the ecosystem, given its current usage in the CLI, we felt that for what we were using it for (minification and bundling relative `@import` rules), Greenwood could potentially support that functionality itself.

So that is what we did!  From this release forward, all CSS minification and bundling will be done by Greenwood.  Along with that, we have been able to drop two dependencies from our _package.json_; though technically three, as we added one back with [**csstree**](https://github.com/csstree/csstree).

No need to change anything, it will happen automatically when you upgrade!  And you can still use this with our [PostCSS plugin](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/tree/master/packages/plugin-postcss). ðŸ‘Œ

> _If you do find any issues or regressions in the CSS output, please file a bug report and we will make sure to fix it ASAP!_

### Build Performance

The last highlight we would like to feature from this release was the introduction of thread pooling for SSR builds.  In adopting these [SSG benchmarks](https://github.com/thescientist13/bench-framework-markdown), it was clear that without some work, Greenwood would not be able to build thousands of pages, let alone quickly.

So under the hood, Greenwood now introduces thread pooling when statically building or pre-rendering pages to avoid crashing NodeJS through the spawning of too many Worker threads.  While it might not be the fastest, at least Greenwood will now be able handle the [thousands of pages](https://github.com/thescientist13/bench-framework-markdown) you may throw at it!


## What's Next

With another release complete, the Greenwood team already has its sights set on the next one.  In keeping with our goal to make _**Full Stack Web Components**_ the best experience possible, we are looking to explore these key features and enhancements next.

- [_NodeJS v18_](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/957) - This will bring native support for `fetch`, JSON Modules, and import assertions!  We plan to make this the new minimum version.
- _Standard and Conventions_ - Runtime wise, Greenwood would like to move in a direction less coupled to NodeJS ([agnostic runtime](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/1008)) and adopting a more web based plugin model, leveraging standard [`Request` and `Response`](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/948) APIs.
- [_API Routes_](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/1007) - We want to make `/api/*` routes happen in Greenwood, so keep an eye out for those coming soon!
- As a project showcase, check out the recently launched **Tuesday's Tunes** [website](https://www.tuesdaystunes.tv/) and [repo](https://github.com/AnalogStudiosRI/www.tuesdaystunes.tv), built with Greenwood and WCC, leveraging Tailwind CSS, content and webhooks powered by Contentful, and built on Netlify!
