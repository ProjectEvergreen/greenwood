# @greenwood/plugin-renderer-lit

## Overview

A Greenwood plugin for using [**Lit**'s SSR capabilities](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/ssr) as a custom server-side renderer instead of Greenwood's default renderer (WCC). This plugin also gives the ability to statically [(pre) render entire pages and layouts](https://greenwoodjs.dev/docs/reference/rendering-strategies/#prerendering) to output completely static sites. For more information and complete docs on Greenwood, please visit [our website](https://www.greenwoodjs.dev).

> This package assumes you already have `@greenwood/cli` installed.

## Prerequisite

This packages depends on the Lit package as a `peerDependency`.  This means you must have Lit already installed in your project.  You can install anything following the `3.x` release line.

```sh
# npm
$ npm -i lit

# yarn
$ yarn add lit

# pnpm
$ pnpm add lit
```

## Installation

You can use your favorite JavaScript package manager to install this package.

```bash
# npm
$ npm i -D @greenwood/plugin-renderer-lit

# yarn
$ yarn add @greenwood/plugin-renderer-lit --dev

# pnpm
$ pnpm add -D @greenwood/plugin-renderer-lit
```

For **pnpm**, you will also want to add this to your _.npmrc_ file
```sh
public-hoist-pattern[]=@lit-labs/*
public-hoist-pattern[]=lit-html
```

## Usage

Add this plugin to your _greenwood.config.js_:

```javascript
import { greenwoodPluginRendererLit } from '@greenwood/plugin-renderer-lit';

export default {
  prerender: true, // enable this flag for SSG

  plugins: [
    greenwoodPluginRendererLit()
  ]
}
```

## Types

Types should automatically be inferred through this package's exports map, but can be referenced explicitly in both JavaScript (JSDoc) and TypeScript files if needed.

```js
/** @type {import('@greenwood/plugin-renderer-lit').LitRendererPlugin} */
```

```ts
import type { LitRendererPlugin } from '@greenwood/plugin-renderer-lit';
```


## Caveats

1. Lit SSR [does not support native `HTMLElement`](https://github.com/lit/lit/discussions/2092) which means **_you will need to use `LitElement` as your base class in all instances where you are pre-rendering or using SSR_**.
1. Be aware of the known documented [caveats](https://lit.dev/docs/ssr/overview/#library-status) as called out in the Lit SSR docs, such as:
    - Lit SSR [**only** renders into declarative shadow roots](https://github.com/lit/lit/issues/3080#issuecomment-1165158794), so you will have to keep browser support and polyfill usage in mind.
    - At this time, `LitElement` does not support `async` work (e.g. for `connectedCallback`).  You can follow along with this issue [in the Lit repo](https://github.com/lit/lit/issues/2469).
1. Lit only supports templates on the server side for HTML generated content, thus Greenwood's `getBody` API must be used.  We would love for [server only components](https://github.com/lit/lit/issues/2469#issuecomment-1759583861) to be a thing though!
1. Lit does not support [`CSSStyleSheet` (aka CSS Modules) in their SSR DOM shim](https://github.com/lit/lit/issues/4862).  As an alternative, you may consider using Greenwood's [**Raw adapter**](https://greenwoodjs.dev/docs/plugins/raw/) to inline CSS in `<style>` tags into your custom elements.
1. Full hydration support is not available yet.  See [this Greenwood issue](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/880) to follow along with when it will land.

## Usage

Add this plugin to your _greenwood.config.js_:

```javascript
import { greenwoodPluginRendererLit } from '@greenwood/plugin-renderer-lit';

export default {
  // ...

  plugins: [
    greenwoodPluginRendererLit()
  ]
}
```

Now, you can author [SSR pages](/docs/server-rendering/) using Lit templates and components using Greenwood's [`getBody` API](https://www.greenwoodjs.dev/docs/pages/server-rendering/#body).  The below is an example of generating a template of LitElement based `<app-card>` web components.

```js
// src/pages/products.js
import { html } from 'lit';
import { getProducts } from '../services/products.js';
import '../components/card.js';

export async function getBody() {
  const products = await getProducts();

  return html`
    ${
      products.map((product, idx) => {
        const { title, thumbnail } = product;

        return html`
          <app-card
            title="${idx + 1}) ${title}"
            thumbnail="${thumbnail}"
          ></app-card>
        `;
      })
    }
  `;
}
```

## Options

### Prerender

The plugin works with Greenwood's [**prerender**](https://greenwoodjs.dev/docs/reference/configuration/#prerender) configuration, allowing for the use of Lit's SSR renderer for [prerendering](https://greenwoodjs.dev/docs/reference/rendering-strategies/#prerendering) your content.

```javascript
import { greenwoodPluginRendererLit } from '@greenwood/plugin-renderer-lit';

export default {
  prerender: true,

  plugins: [
    greenwoodPluginRendererLit()
  ]
}
```

> _Keep in mind you will need to make sure your Lit Web Components are isomorphic and [properly leveraging `LitElement`'s lifecycles](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/labs/ssr#notes-and-limitations) and browser / Node APIs accordingly for maximum compatibility and portability._

### Isolation Mode

By default, this plugin sets `isolation` mode to `true` for all SSR pages.  If you want to override this, just export an `isolation` const.

```js
// src/pages/products.js
export const isolation = false;
```

> _See the [isolation configuration](https://www.greenwoodjs.dev/docs/reference/configuration/#isolation-mode) docs for more information._

### Hydration

In order for server-rendered components to become interactive on the client side, Lit's [client-side hydration script](https://lit.dev/docs/ssr/client-usage/#loading-@lit-labsssr-clientlit-element-hydrate-support.js) must be included on the page.  This setting is `true` by default, but if you want to turn it off, you can `export` the **hydration** option from your page with a value of `false`.

```js
// src/pages/products.js
export const hydration = false; // disable Lit hydration scripts for this page
```
