# Greenwood

## Overview
A modern and performant static site generator supporting Web Component based development.

> ⛔ WARNING: This project is not ready for use yet! 🛠️

## Usage
By default, Greenwood will generate a site for you in _public/_.
```shell
$ greenwood
```

Fun!  But naturally you'll want to make your own pages.  So create a folder called _src/pages/_ and create a page called _index.md_.
```shell
---
path: '/hello'
label: 'hello'
---
