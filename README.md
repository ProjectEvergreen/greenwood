## Overview
Greenwood is a modern and performant static site generator supporting Web Component based development.  For more information about how to get started, lookup our docs, or learn more about the project, please visit our [website](https://www.greenwoodjs.io/).

> Greenwood is currently working towards a [1.0 release](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues/418) with plans in our [next release (v.0.10.0)](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/pull/436) to introduce some exciting [new changes and concepts](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/releases/tag/v0.10.0-alpha.0) to the project.  Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/projects) to see what we're working on next and feel free to reach out through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood/issues) if you have any issues.

## Getting Started
Our website has a complete [Getting Started](http://www.greenwoodjs.io/getting-started) section that will walk you through creating a Greenwood project from scratch.

You can follow along with, or clone and go, the [companion repo](https://github.com/ProjectEvergreen/greenwood-getting-started).

## Installation
Greenwood can be installed with your favorite JavaScript package manager.
```bash
# npm
npm -i @greenwood/cli --save-dev

# yarn
yarn add @greenwood/cli --dev
```

Then in your _package.json_, you can run the CLI like so:
```javascript
"scripts": {
  "build": "greenwood build",
  "start": "greenwood develop",
  "eject": "greenwood eject",
}
```

- `npm run build`: generates a static build of your project
- `npm start`: starts a local development server for your project
- `npm run eject`: ejects configurations to your working directory for additional customizations
